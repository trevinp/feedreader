# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in..

# How to run the Feed Reader application
1. Download the project files from https://github.com/trevinp/feedreader
2. Use a web browser and open the "index.html" file
3. The feeds will load and after some time will display on the webpage
4. The project uses the jasmine testing framework to display the test results, see http://jasmine.github.io/
